# NetflixRecommendationSystem
A content-based Netflix recommendation system built using NLP and unsupervised learning. It analyzes textual metadata (title, cast, genres, description) to cluster similar movies and TV shows using TF-IDF, SVD, and KMeans, and recommends related content through cosine similarity—without relying on user ratings or watch history.
